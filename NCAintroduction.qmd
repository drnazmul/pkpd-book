title: "Noncompartmental Data Analysis (105-OD) "
---

Noncompartmental analysis (NCA) is a fundamental tool used 

- to analyze pharmacokinetic or drug concentration time data 

- to understand better how the body handles the drug

In this course you will learn 

- how to calculate parameters associated with non-compartmental analysis

- What those parameters mean 

- what their impact is and how to interpret changes in the parameters

We will examine all the equations and methodologies that are employed in NCA  

Topics to cover:


Observed parameters

Half-life
Area Under the Curve AUC
Clearance 
Statistical moments
Data presentation
Bioequivalnece 
Study design consideration
Limitations

Observed parameters


## Presenting PK results

1.  Individual observations
2.  Calculated PK parameter results
3.  Statistical results of comparisons
4.  Discussion of results
5.  Relevant conclusions (that addresses the study objective)

How to present concentration data

-   Individual concentration values in listings

-   Individual concentration-time plots (both linear and semi-logarithomic)

-   Combined plot of all individual concentration time data

-   Summary statistics by nominal time points

Example of individual listing:

PK parameters

-   Individual parameter values in listing

-   summary statistics by treatment (for small data, include individual parameter values)

-   Graphical presentation of the parameters are useful

Proper use of descriptive statistics

Discrete variables: Variables that can only take on a certain number of values (eg whole number). Main statistics used are: N, minimum, maximum, median

-   mean and SD don't make sense for discrete variables

-   tmax and tlag are discrete variables because they can only take on values of the specific blood draw times

Continues variables

Variables that can take on any value within a range of values (eg wright)
