What is a Model\n\na mathematical abstraction\na diagram of a typical PK model\n\n - The movement of drug through the body is usually much more complicated than depicted in the diagram but even a simple model such as this can mimic the shape of the observed data and allow us to make predictions.\n\nmodels can be anywhere from purely empirical to purely mechanistic\n\nempirical model is used just because it fits the data without drawing too many conclusions about the process that the drug undergoes while being absorbed distributed metabolized and eliminated\na mechanistic model accounts for many of the processes that the drug is known to undergo\nthe model in the diagram is translated into a series of differential equations\n\nThe equations that describe the model are converted into model code in Phoenix\nParameter values"

Parameterization\n\nparameterization refers to the type of parameters that are used in the model\nexamples include clearance parameters micro parameters and macro parameters\n\nlet’s see how these differ first let’s consider\nclearance parameters\n\nthe most widely used\nThe parameters in this model are the absorption rate constant the clearance and the volume\nwe suggest using clearance parameters when possible because\n\nclearances are physiologically relevant and\nclearance-based models tend to be more stable\nit is also easy to obtain initial estimates by using parameters from NCA\n\n\nmicro-parameters\n\nAll the transport is defined in terms of rate constants\nThese models are also widely used particularly for more mechanistic\nIn the picture model both KA and Ke are rate constants and v is the volume\n\nmacro parameter\n\nThese were the first type of parameters to be used in PK modeling\nPK curve is given by an equation that is combination of one or more exponentials\nthese parameters are not directly related to the phyiology\n\nClearance paremeters and microparameters are easily convertable. Let’s look at the\nFirts, let’s consider microparameters:\n - drug can move in both direction k: rate constants A ;amount of drug in the originative compartment\nNext the clearance parameters  Clearance and microcompartment models are usally equivalent and gives similar results. However, clearance models are more commonly used.\n ## 3. administration\nthe way the drug is administered has a large effect on the shape of the PK curve. three types of administration\n\nExtravascular\n\n\nOral, subcautaneous, intervanious, etc any kind of administration that involves an absorption\nthere is a depot compartment that receives the dose\nin Phoenix the dose point is indicated with the blue syringe, The name of the absorption compartment is AA and the absorption rate constant is KA any administration\n\n\nIntravenous (IV infusion or IV bolus)\n\n\nDelivered at a constant rate for a defined duration or rate\nthere is no absorption process and the dose point delivers the drug directly into the central compartment\n\nlet’s compare the shapes of PK curves resulting from different administration methods here are three simulations all with - a dose of 5,000 micrograms - a volume of 100 liters - a clearance of 20 liters per hour and - an absorption rate constant ka of 1 per hour\n\n\n\n\nthe elimination phase is linear in all three plots and there is no distribution phase seen"
