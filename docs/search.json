Let’s look at the\nFirts, let’s consider microparameters:\n - drug can move in both direction k: rate constants A ;amount of drug in the originative compartment\nNext the clearance parameters  Clearance and microcompartment models are usally equivalent and gives similar results. However, clearance models are more commonly used.\n ## 3. administration\nthe way the drug is administered has a large effect on the shape of the PK curve. three types of administration\n\nExtravascular\n\n\nOral, subcautaneous, intervanious, etc any kind of administration that involves an absorption\nthere is a depot compartment that receives the dose\nin Phoenix the dose point is indicated with the blue syringe, The name of the absorption compartment is AA and the absorption rate constant is KA any administration\n\n\nIntravenous (IV infusion or IV bolus)\n\n\nDelivered at a constant rate for a defined duration or rate\nthere is no absorption process and the dose point delivers the drug directly into the central compartment\n\nlet’s compare the shapes of PK curves resulting from different administration methods here are three simulations all with - a dose of 5,000 micrograms - a volume of 100 liters - a clearance of 20 liters per hour and - an absorption rate constant ka of 1 per hour\n\n\n\n\nthe elimination phase is linear in all three plots and there is no distribution phase seen"
