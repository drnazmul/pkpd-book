    "section": "1.4 Introduction to NCA",
    "text": "1.4 Introduction to NCA\n\n1.4.1 About NCA\nNon-compartmental analysis or NCA is a method for quantifying drug exposure\n\nNCA determines a large number of pharmacokinetic descriptors or PK parameters for a drug\nThey are not really parameters as you would have in a model\nNCA does not use any kind of model other than assuming that the elimination can be described by first order kinetics\nbecause there is no model at the heart of the method we cannot really use it for predictions\nAn example plot of concentration over time following an extravascular dose NCA will give us two different measures of drug exposure:\n\nthe peak exposure to the drug concentration occurring after dosing\nThe overall exposure is measured by computing the area under the curve or AUC\nan extra vascular dose starts with a concentration of zero, the concentration rises rapidly reaches Cmax and then decreases\n\n\nwith extra vascular dosing there is an absorption process that leads to a maximum concentration followed by elimination\nIV bolus dosing: drug is directly injected all at once into a vein; the mixing and systemic circulation is very fast and by the time the first sample is taken after dosing the mixing is assumed to be complete. The concentration starts high and then decreases as the drug is eliminated.\nIV infusion: the concentration starts at zero and then rises if the infusion is continued for long enough the concentration approaches a plateau at steady state when the infusion stops the concentration then falls in the same manner as in ivy bolus dosing\nplotting on a log scale is useful because it usually shows linear elimination in each case regardless of the dosing root we could fit the linear portion with a straight line to predict what will happen to concentration after we’ve collected the last sample concentration on the log axis\n\n\n\nIt is useful to have both linear and log plots. Linear plots are useful for examining the peak concentration and log plots are useful for the low concentrations\nIn addition to an elimination phase many drugs also show a distribution phase in such cases there may be two distinctive straight line sections on the plot. Although sometimes the two phases blend into a general curvature in the plots we see here the distribution phase is apparent for all three dosing routs but it is most pronounced for the IV bolus dosing. For extravascular dosing the distribution phase may be obscured by the drug absorption.\nThe AUC can be determined no matter how complex the relationship between concentration and time.\nSummary:\nNCA is the primary method of assessing drug exposure.\nCmax is a measure of peak exposure\nAUC is a measure of the overall exposure to the drug\ndifferent dosing route leads to a curve with the distinctive shape that plotting on a log concentration scale usually shows linear elimination\nmany drugs show a distribution phase as well as an elimination phase\n\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Observe Parameters\n\nFrom the plot of concentration versus time, we can see that the maximum concentration is reached at about 1 hour, we call that time Tmax and the concentration at the peak is Cmax\nTmax and Cmax are listed in the output of NCA in Phoenix\nAt some point after dosing we will have our last observed concentration this may be because we have stopped collecting samples or the concentration may have dropped below the quantification limit for the analysis and therefore we were unable to get more values The point is at a time of t last and has a concentration of Tlast These observeed parameters are affected by the sampling schedule we can improve our chances by sampling richly around the expected time of c max if we have more points we have a better chance of capturing a concentration that is near the true maximum\n\nSummarize\n\nObserved parameters are TMax Cmax TLast and Clast. We call these observed parameters because they are found directly in the observations\nthe observed parameters are dependent on sampling times\nsample richly around the expected time of Cmax so you can have a better chance of capturing something close to the true maximum\n\n\n\n1.4.3 Half-Life\n\ntime it takes for the concentration to decrease by 50%.\na long half-life leads to a shallower slope and a short half-life leads to a steeper slope\nsome drugs exhibit two phases a distribution phase and an elimination phase each of these will have a half-life associated with it The shorter the half-life of the distribution phase the steeper the initial decline will be although we usually concentrate on the half-life of the elimination phase the effective half-life of the drug may very well depend on the half-lives of both of these processes\nIt takes five to seven half lives to eliminate the drug.\n\n\n\n1.4.4 Area Under the Curve (AUC)\nHow to calculate AUC?\n\nassume that the concentration follows a stright line between points\none triangle and several trapizoid\nAUC is calculated from concentration-time data\nTrapezoids are used to estimate AUC between two data points\nAUC is the sum of the areas of all the trapezoids plus one triangle\n\n\n\n1.4.5 Extrapolation to Infinity\n\nafter the Tlast there are still large quantity of drug in the plasma\nHow can we extrapolate to infinity?\nWe need a way to calculate the AUC Tlast - infinity.\nSlope of the elimination is the key, apparent terminal phase, magnitide of the slope is \\(\\lambda_Z\\)\n\n\\[\nAUC _{tlast - \\infty} = \\frac{C_{last}}{\\lambda_z}\n\\] \\[\nAUC _{0 - \\infty} = AUC_{last} + \\frac{C_{last}}{\\lambda_z}\n\\]\n\nextrapolatd area should be below 20%\n\nImportant NCA parameters:\n\nIndependent of least\nsquares fit, such as Cmax, Tmax, AUClast,\nDependent on the least-squares fit: Lamda Z, AUC 0-inf, %Extrapolation, terminal half-life, volume, clearance\n\n\n\n1.4.6 Volume of Distribution\n\\[\nC = \\frac{Dose}{V}\n\\]\n\nvolume of distribution relates to the dose and concentration\nDoes not corresponds to anything physiological\nExample, 100 ug dose to IV bolus and 2 ug/L concentration, volume is 50L.\ntypical human plasma volume is 5 L, why V is sometimes very large?\nDrugs that are strongly bound to protein has very high V\n\n\n\n1.4.7 Clearance\n\n\n1.4.8 Linear vs Log"
